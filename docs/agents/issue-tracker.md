# Issue tracker: local markdown

Issues for this repo live as markdown files under `.scratch/`. That directory is
**gitignored**, so issues are local to one working copy: nothing publishes them, and a
fresh clone starts empty. Specs are the exception, and they are tracked.

## Specs live in `specs/`, not `.scratch/`

This repo had a spec convention before this file existed, and that convention stays
authoritative:

- One file per unit of forward-looking work at `specs/NNNN-slug.md`, numbered from `0001`.
- `specs/README.md` holds the index table (spec, kind, effort, summary). A new spec adds a
  row; a landed spec removes it.
- A spec states the problem, the evidence for it, the proposed change, and the seam it will
  be tested through. It does not record a decision.
- When the work lands, delete the spec. If it settled something durable, write an ADR under
  `docs/adr/` instead. See `docs/adr/README.md`.

"Write a spec" therefore means `specs/NNNN-slug.md`, tracked in git. "Publish an issue"
means a file under `.scratch/`, which is not.

## Issue conventions

- One feature per directory: `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`
- Implementation issues are one file per ticket at
  `.scratch/<feature-slug>/issues/<NN>-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`. Never a single
  combined tickets file.
- Triage state is a `Status:` line near the top of each issue file. The role strings live in
  `triage-labels.md`.
- Comments and conversation history append to the bottom of the file under a `## Comments`
  heading.

## When a skill says "publish to the issue tracker"

Create a new file under `.scratch/<feature-slug>/`, creating the directory if needed.

## When a skill says "fetch the relevant ticket"

Read the file at the referenced path. The user normally passes the path or the issue number
directly.

## Wayfinding operations

Used by `/wayfinder`. The **map** is a file with one **child** file per ticket.

- **Map**: `.scratch/<effort>/map.md`, holding the Notes / Decisions-so-far / Fog body.
- **Child ticket**: `.scratch/<effort>/issues/NN-<slug>.md`, numbered from `01`, with the
  question in the body. A `Type:` line records the ticket type
  (`research`/`prototype`/`grilling`/`task`); a `Status:` line records `claimed`/`resolved`.
- **Blocking**: a `Blocked by: NN, NN` line near the top. A ticket is unblocked when every
  file it lists is `resolved`.
- **Frontier**: scan `.scratch/<effort>/issues/` for files that are open, unblocked and
  unclaimed; first by number wins.
- **Claim**: set `Status: claimed` and save before any work.
- **Resolve**: append the answer under an `## Answer` heading, set `Status: resolved`, then
  append a context pointer (gist plus link) to the map's Decisions-so-far in `map.md`.
