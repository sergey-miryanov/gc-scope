# NNNN — <imperative title: what will be true once this lands>

> Copy this file to `specs/NNNN-kebab-title.md` and delete every `>` guidance line as you
> fill it in. See [README §Conventions](README.md#conventions) for the rules these
> sections exist to enforce.

- **Status:** Not started | In progress | Blocked (`<on what>`) | **Pinned** (`<test that locks current behavior>`)
- **Kind:** bug — crash | correctness | safety | regression | reporting | cosmetic
- **Effort:** XS | S | M | L
- **Origin:** `<where this came from — a review, a CI failure, an issue, a session>`
- **Respects:** `<ADR links whose decisions this must not contradict, or "—">`

## 1. Problem

> What the **operator** experiences, in their words — the command they ran and what went
> wrong. Not the faulty expression; that is §2. One short paragraph.

## 2. Evidence

> Why we believe it. Anchor on **symbols** — `module::function`, a type, a constant — never
> on line numbers, which go stale within a refactor and turn a spec into an archaeology
> exercise.
>
> Quote code only where the defect **is** the code (a wrong operator, a missing branch, an
> unchecked subtraction) and prose cannot be more precise. Trim to the decision-rich part
> and label it with the symbol it lives in. If the evidence is external — a CPython header,
> an ABI rule — cite it with enough detail to re-check without the original session.

## 3. Scope

> Two lists, both explicit. **Affected:** which commands, which Python versions, which
> platforms. **Not affected:** the near neighbours a reader would otherwise assume are
> broken — this is what stops the fix growing. Say why CI didn't catch it, if it didn't;
> that gap is usually the most useful line in the spec.

## 4. Proposed change

> The fix, as numbered steps. State the shape of the change, not a patch. Where a choice
> was already settled, say which option and why the others lose; where it is open, say so
> and name what would settle it.

## 5. Seams and testing decisions

> Sketch the seam **before** the implementation starts, and prefer an existing one — the
> fewer distinct seams this codebase has, the better. Use the highest seam that can observe
> the defect: a CLI-level assertion beats a library call, which beats reaching into a
> private function. If a new seam is genuinely needed, propose it at the highest point it
> can live, and prefer an honest public signal over a `test-hooks` gate
> ([ADR 0005](../docs/adr/0005-testing-strategy.md)).

- **Seam:** `<the one seam this is tested through, and why it is the highest available>`
- **New seam needed:** `<none | what, at what level, and why nothing existing reaches it>`
- **What makes a good test here:** `<external behavior only. For anything decoding a live
  interpreter, assert the decoded *shape* — a wrong offset yields a full table of plausible
  garbage that a non-empty check waves through.>`
- **Prior art:** `<the closest existing test to model this on>`
- **Cases:**
  1. `<the case that fails today>`
  2. `<the regression guard: what must stay byte-identical>`

## 6. Out of scope

> What a reader might reasonably expect to be included and is not, with the reason. Adjacent
> defects, the larger refactor this one gestures at, the feature someone will suggest.

## 7. Further notes

> Anything that does not fit above: history, a rejected approach and why, a dependency on
> another spec. Delete the section if empty.
